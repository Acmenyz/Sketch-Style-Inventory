# Style Inventory for Sketch

Design requires free, sometimes chaotic exploration. But design also means organisation and structure. Sketch can be good in both aspects, but moving from exploration to structured layouts with text styles and unified colors is hard. Either you start clean files from scratch, or you use what you have and try to tidy it up. The Style Inventory is meant to help you with that. It gives you an overview of all your used styles and helps you to merge styles of similar layers into one. Does select layer by color or select layer by text style ring a bell? :)

## Style Inventory
Generate a visual style sheet with all colors and text styles that you are using. This will help you to get an overview of your used styles so you can merge styles that are very close together. (-> Select all matching layers by color or text style) You can also export a SCSS or JSON file to use your styles in your web projects. (-> Style Inventory Tagger) When you run this plugin again, Sketch will update your Style Inventory while keeping variable names.

## Style Inventory Tagger
A simple wizard that will guide you through your styles that are missing variable names. Use this to provide more information for SASS and JSON export. 

## Select layer by color or text style
Based on a selection, Sketch will show you a list of layers that have the exact same color or text style.

## Select all matching layers by color or text style
Based on a selection, Sketch will expand the selection to all other layers with the exact same color or text style.

## Select next layer by color or text style
Based on a selection, Sketch will select the next layer with the same color or text style.

## Select next previous by color or text style
Based on a selection, Sketch will select the previous layer with the same color or text style.
